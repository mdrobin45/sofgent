Software Testing Services involve processes designed to evaluate the functionality, performance, security, and usability of software applications before delivering them to customers. The primary goal is to identify defects or issues before the software is deployed, ensuring it meets specified requirements and functions correctly.

These services cater to both new and existing software. For new software, testing assesses how it operates and checks for bugs. In the case of existing software, performance is monitored. For example, customers can provide all necessary materials, and Sofgen can conduct testing and deploy bug-free software.

While testing focuses on ensuring the software works correctly before user deployment, maintenance involves keeping the software operational and up-to-date post-release. Sofgen offers both outsourcing options.
