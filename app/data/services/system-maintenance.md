System Maintenance encompasses regular activities performed to keep computer systems or software applications running smoothly and efficiently after delivery. This includes tasks like updating software, fixing bugs, monitoring performance, and ensuring security. System maintenance can be either proactive (preventive) or reactive (corrective) to ensure that systems are up-to-date and functioning correctly.

Outsourcing maintenance services is beneficial for existing software needing support to operate smoothly. Companies can hire a dedicated team from Sofgent to identify and resolve bugs in their software. This can be a one-time solution or an ongoing service, with options available for both.
